# Yo! Welcome to my new project!

But like, what _is_ this, Harry?

Well, this is a new project that I'm gonna be working on for a little while. Essentially, you enter the name of a musical artist, and through some kind of process that, if I'm honest, I'm not sure of yet, this system is going to fetch you some of their influences, and fetch a "Top Track" for each one of them.

## You should figure that process out. That sounds great, though - what're you going to build in?

I'm planning to upskill myself a little, working with new stuff that I don't have too much experience with - namely, Object-Oriented Vanilla JavaScript, and a pre-processor for my CSS, SASS. I'm also going to be using AngularJS. I might try to use something for my HTML, too. 

Maybe Pug, because, let's face it, pugs are pretty cool.

## They are. What's this project called, by the way?

It's called _Musical Influences_, for now. I'll figure out a clever name further down the road.
